# Scrcpy Deck

Scrcpy Deck is a high-performance, cross-subsystem graphical control deck and management interface for Genymobile's [scrcpy](https://github.com/Genymobile/scrcpy) and the Android Debug Bridge (ADB). Engineered in Python and CustomTkinter, Scrcpy Deck eliminates the friction of command-line flag assembly while preserving low-latency screen mirroring, bi-directional input simulation, camera streaming, and device administration.

## Technical Overview

Scrcpy Deck bridges high-level desktop user interactions with low-level Android hardware execution pipelines. The application orchestrates headless ADB daemon communication, handles non-blocking multi-process streaming, manages hardware discovery via mDNS, and provides real-time diagnostic stream telemetry.

### Core Architectural Highlights

- **Asynchronous Execution Architecture**: All ADB queries, process monitoring loops, and stream handlers run on isolated background threads, ensuring an unblocked 60 FPS graphical interface.
- **Hardware-Aware Device Identification**: Integrates deep Android property inspection (`getprop`) across OEM subsystems (Samsung, Xiaomi/HyperOS, OnePlus, Oppo/ColorOS, Vivo, Realme, Motorola) alongside a hardware mapping database to resolve opaque serial identifiers into precise marketing designations.
- **Dynamic mDNS and Wireless Pairing**: Supports both traditional USB-assisted TCP/IP switching and Android 11+ dynamic TLS pairing protocols (`adb pair` and `adb connect`) with automated port resolution.
- **Multi-Sensor Camera Subsystem**: Exposes Android 12+ camera streaming pipelines with physical sensor discovery (`--list-cameras`), lens selection, aspect ratio enforcement, torch toggling, digital zoom, and real-time resolution constraints.
- **Direct Input & OTG Modes**: Supports standard HID injection over mirroring protocols as well as pure USB OTG emulation (`--otg`) for physical keyboard/mouse pass-through without display rendering overhead.
- **Diagnostic Engine and Telemetry**: Captures standard output and error descriptors in real time, classifying logs into severity streams with an integrated heuristic engine that delivers contextual remediation steps for connection and encoding faults.

## Installation & Deployment

### Method 1: Windows Installer (Recommended for End Users)

1. Download the latest `scrcpy-deck-<version>-setup.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/xosmos01-cyber/Scrcpy-GUI-by-EXPOSUREEE/releases) page.
2. Execute the installer. The installer automatically:
   - Deploys the standalone executable and bundled assets.
   - Bundles required SDL2, SDL3, FFmpeg (`avcodec`, `avformat`, `avutil`, `swresample`), and LibUSB runtime binaries.
   - Installs the Universal ADB Driver package silently in the background if driver interfaces are absent.
3. Launch **Scrcpy Deck** from the Start Menu or Desktop shortcut.

### Method 2: Running from Source

Clone the repository and configure a dedicated virtual environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/xosmos01-cyber/Scrcpy-GUI-by-EXPOSUREEE.git
cd Scrcpy-GUI-by-EXPOSUREEE

# Initialize and activate Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required Python dependencies
pip install customtkinter pillow
```

Ensure that `adb.exe`, `scrcpy.exe`, `scrcpy-server`, and required runtime DLLs reside in the root directory (or are globally available on your system `PATH`).

Execute the application entry point:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Operational Workflows

### 1. Wired USB Mirroring
1. Connect your Android device to the PC using a verified data-capable USB cable.
2. Ensure `USB Debugging` is active on your device and accept the RSA host authorization prompt when prompted.
3. Open Scrcpy Deck and navigate to **Quick Connect**.
4. Click **Scan Devices**. Select your target from the **Active Devices** menu.
5. Click **Start Mirroring** in the header action bar.

### 2. USB-Assisted Wireless Connection
1. Connect the device via USB initially.
2. Under **Quick Connect** > **Wireless ADB (Wi-Fi)**, select the **USB Assisted** mode tab.
3. Click **Auto get IP** to query the local `wlan0` interface address.
4. Click **Enable TCP/IP Mode** to instruct the on-device ADB daemon to listen on port 5555.
5. Click **Connect Wirelessly**. Once confirmed, disconnect the USB cable and click **Start Mirroring**.

### 3. Android 11+ Direct Wireless Pairing (No USB Required)
1. Ensure the desktop PC and Android device reside on the same Wi-Fi subnet.
2. On the device, navigate to `Settings` > `Developer Options` > `Wireless Debugging` > `Pair device with pairing code`.
3. In Scrcpy Deck, select **Direct Pairing (Android 11+)**.
4. Enter the displayed IP address, ephemeral Pair Port, and 6-digit Wi-Fi Pairing Code, then click **Pair Device**.
5. Read the main connect port displayed on the device's Wireless Debugging root screen (or click **Auto-detect** via mDNS), input it into **Connect Port**, and click **Connect**.

### 4. High-Resolution Camera Streaming
1. Open **Advanced Controls** (or the quick settings dialog via the gear icon).
2. Set **Mirror Source** to `Back Camera` or `Front Camera`.
3. In **Scrcpy Camera Options**, select your target lens ID, desired sensor aspect ratio (e.g., `16:9`), and frame rate limit.
4. Optional: Enable **Camera Torch** for hardware illumination or adjust **Camera Zoom**.
5. Click **Start Mirroring** to launch the camera feed without audio overhead.

### 5. Pure OTG Peripheral Emulation
1. Open **Quick Settings** (gear icon) and switch to the **Screen** tab.
2. Under **Connection Mode**, toggle **OTG (Control Only)**.
3. Click **Apply & Close** and initiate the session. The desktop keyboard and mouse will control the Android device as native USB HID input devices without video capturing or decoding.

## Troubleshooting & Diagnostics

### Common Diagnostic Remediation

- **Device Unauthorized (`unauthorized`)**:
  - Unlock the Android device.
  - Check for the "Allow USB debugging?" dialog on the phone screen and tap "Always allow from this computer".
  - If the prompt does not appear, navigate to **Quick Connect** > **ADB Controls** and click **Reset Connections** to regenerate host RSA keypairs.

- **ADB Daemon / Port Conflicts (`cannot connect to daemon`)**:
  - Third-party emulators or vendor suites (e.g., Samsung Smart Switch, BlueStacks) may hold locks on port 5037.
  - Click **Kill ADB Server** in the **ADB Controls** section, or execute `adb kill-server` inside the **Terminal Console**.

- **Dynamic IP Changes on Wireless Reconnect**:
  - When reconnecting to a saved device whose DHCP lease has changed, Scrcpy Deck triggers the **Auto-Recover** wizard.
  - Reconnect the phone via USB momentarily; the application will automatically query the new IP, rebind TCP/IP mode, update configuration records, and restore wireless connectivity.

- **Capture or Encoding Initialization Failures**:
  - High-resolution streams may exceed hardware encoder limits on older mobile chipsets.
  - Navigate to **Display & Quality** and reduce **Max Resolution Size** to `1080` or `720`, switch the **Video Codec** to `h264`, or lower the **Stream Bitrate**.
